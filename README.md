> Create a farm full of animals using inheritence

## Project Requirements:
Using classes and objects, implement a farm. Create a class containing a `Main()` function that exercises your other classes. Create classes representing several types of domesticated animals, such as cows, sheep, chickens, goats, etc. Instantiate several objects of each class. For example, for your Rabbit class, you might instantiate objects Bugs Bunny, Roger Rabbit, Thumper, and Peter Cottontail.

### **One class, one method**

Implement one farm animal by creating a class and a method. For example, you may elect to create a Horse type, and a `Speak()` method. In your main program, instantiate a Horse, name him MrEd, and call the `Speak()` method. When Mr. Ed speaks, he might say something like, "Hello, my name is Mr. Ed, and I am a horse. I say neigh."

### **Four classes, one method**
Create four or more animals. Implement a method for each. You can implement a `Speak()` method for each animal. A pig can say, "Oink." A cow can say, "Moo." A chicken can say, "Cluck." You get the idea.

### **Four classes, four methods**
For each class, provide four or more methods. You can have an `Eat()` method: horses eat hay, cows eat grass, pigs eat anything, etc. You can have a `Product()` method: horses provide transportation, cows provide beef, pigs provide pork, etc. Use your imagination.
